          <p>
            ArbVault represents the evolution of GadgetSphere, a beloved marketplace that served 
            collectors and enthusiasts from 2018 to 2023. When GadgetSphere's original founders 
            decided to pursue other ventures, a group of passionate users and developers came 
            together to preserve what made the platform special while addressing its limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We acquired the platform's infrastructure and user feedback database in late 2023, 
            spending months rebuilding from the ground up with a focus on trust, security, and 
            user protection. The result is ArbVault - a marketplace that honors GadgetSphere's 
            community spirit while implementing the robust protections high-value transactions demand.

              One of ArbVault's most vocal advocates is <strong>Dex Volkov</strong>, a tech 
              enthusiast and author who discovered our platform after being unfairly deplatformed 
              from major online retailers. Dex isn't affiliated with ArbVault's management - he's 
              simply a power user who believes in what we're building.

              Dex operates one of our premier storefronts, specializing in rare tech and 
              professional equipment. His commitment to customer service and adherence to our
